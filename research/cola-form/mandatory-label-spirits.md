# Distilled Spirits Labeling: Mandatory Label Information

A label or labels  bearing the brand name, alcohol content, and class, type, or other designation must appear in the same field of vision. Same field of vision means a single side of a container where all of the pieces of information can be viewed simultaneously without the need to turn the container (for a cylindrical container, a side is 40 percent of the circumference). TTB regulations require that certain information appear in the same field of vision of a distilled spirits container. Other mandatory information, and additional information, may appear on any label.

**Where should such a label be placed on the product?**

The label bearing the brand name, alcohol content and class, type, or other designation may appear on the front, back, or side of the container. It does not need to be the label that faces the consumer in a retail display.

**What information must appear on such a label?**

The following information must appear in the same field of vision:

- [Brand name](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2543) in accordance with [27 CFR 5.64(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5532a3f3837e89018321d9015c559787&mc=true&node=pt27.1.5&rgn=div5#se27.1.5_134)

- [Class or type designation](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/spirits_bam/chapter4.pdf "chapter4.pdf") in accordance with [subpart I of 27 CFR Part 5.141;(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5532a3f3837e89018321d9015c559787&mc=true&node=pt27.1.5&rgn=div5#se27.1.5_135) and

- [Alcohol content](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2545) in accordance with [27 CFR 5.65(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5532a3f3837e89018321d9015c559787&mc=true&node=pt27.1.5&rgn=div5#se27.1.5_137)

Other mandatory information (including some information that is mandatory only in certain circumstances) may appear on any label. This includes name and address, net contents, neutral spirits, coloring or treatment with wood, FD&C Yellow #5 disclosure, aspartame, carmine or cochineal extract, sulfite declaration, commodity statement, age statement, and state of distillation.
