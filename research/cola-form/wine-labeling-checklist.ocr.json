A varietal is considered the class/type designation if it is present on the brand label. ☐ If yes, does the listing match the “Grape Varietal(s)” field on the application? ☐ For domestic wine, is each varietal approved for domestic use? ☐ Is it a wine that requires a formula? (Check wine formula requirements here.) ☐ If yes, is the statement of composition the same as the suggested general statement on the approved formula (under Determination and Labeling Instructions) or more specific? ☐ Has the approved formula number been selected on the application? ☐ Are this and other labels on the container free from conflicting or inconsistent designations? (e.g., “red wine with natural flavors” vs. “red wine”)  |\n|  Appellation of Origin An area where the fruit or agricultural product used to make the wine was grown. | 27 CFR 4.25 27 CFR 4.34 | Generally, mandatory ONLY if the label contains a grape varietal type designation, a type designation of varietal significance, a vintage date, or a semi-generic type designation, or if the product is labeled as estate bottled. See Appellation of Origin for more information. ☐ Is the country, state, county, American Viticultural Area or other appellation shown on the brand label together with the designation? ☐ Does the appellation on the label match the “Appellation” field on the application?  |\n|  Percentage of Foreign Wine Example: 50% American wine/50% French wine | 27 CFR 4.32(a)(4) | Mandatory for blends of American and foreign wine ONLY if the label refers to foreign wine.  |",
