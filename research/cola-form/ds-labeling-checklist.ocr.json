The same field of vision means a single side of a container (for a cylindrical container, a side is 40 percent of the circumference) where all of the pieces of information can be viewed simultaneously without the need to turn the container.

You may use: “Alc.”, “Alc”, “Vol.”, “Vol”, or “%”. Note: The label may state the alcohol content in degrees of proof but this statement must be adequately distinguished from the mandatory statement of alcohol content as a percentage by volume (for example, it may appear in parentheses or brackets), and as long as it appears in the same field of vision as the mandatory statement of alcohol content as a percentage of alcohol by volume.  |\n|  Mandatory information that may appear on ANY Label  |   |   |\n|  Mandatory Item and Description | Regulatory Citation | Checklist  |\n|  Net Contents Volume of distilled spirits in container. | 27 CFR 5.70 27 CFR 5.203 | ☐ Is the net contents statement present on the label, or is it blown into or otherwise marked on the container? ☐ Are the format and abbreviations acceptable (e.g. 500 mL or 1.5 L)?  |",
