# Malt Beverage Labeling: Mandatory Label Information

TTB regulations require that certain mandatory information appear on the labeling of a malt beverage container.

**What mandatory information is required to be placed on malt beverage labels?**

Malt beverage containers must bear a label or labels with the following mandatory information:

- [Brand name](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2743) in accordance with [27 CFR 7.64(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-7.64);
- [Class and type designation](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2737) in accordance with [27 CFR 7.141(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-7.141);
- [Net Contents](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2734) (which may be blown, embossed, or molded into the container) in accordance with [27 CFR 7.70(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-7.70);
- Name and Address ( [domestic](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2744))( [imports](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2736)) (which may be blown, embossed, or molded into the container) in accordance with [27 CFR 7.66(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-7.66)– [68(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-7.68);
- [Alcohol Content](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2720) (when the product contains alcohol derived from flavors or added non-beverage ingredients (other than hops extract) containing alcohol) in accordance with [27 CFR 7.63(a)(3)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7#p-7.63(a)(3));
- If present, FD&C Yellow No. 5, cochineal extract or carmine, sulfites, and aspartame in accordance with [27 CFR 7.63(b)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7#p-7.63(b)); and
- If the product is imported, the country of origin in accordance with [U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rules(link is external)](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/rulings/informed-compliance-publications/marking-country-origin-us-imports), as stated in [27 CFR 7.69(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7#7.69).

**Note:** The [health warning statement](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2728) must appear on all containers of alcohol beverages for sale or distribution in the United States. Under the regulations in [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-16), the statement may appear on a front label, back label, or side label. See [27 CFR 16.21(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-16#16.21).

**What constitutes a label for the purposes of mandatory information?**

For the purposes of mandatory information, the label includes any material affixed to the container, such as paper, plastic, or metal. Additionally, the net contents and name and address statements may be blown, embossed, or molded into the container as part of the process of manufacturing the container. Mandatory information may be etched, engraved, sandblasted, or otherwise carved into the container or branded, stenciled, painted, printed, or otherwise directly applied to the surface of the container.

Note that information appearing on the following parts of the container is subject to all of the restrictions and prohibitions set forth in subparts [F(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-7/subpart-F), [G(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-7/subpart-G), and [H(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-7/subpart-H) of part 7, but will not satisfy the requirements for mandatory information that must appear on labels:

- The bottom surface of a container;
- Caps, corks, or other closures, unless authorized to bear mandatory information by the appropriate TTB officer; and
- Foil or heat shrink bottle capsules

For more information on this topic, see [27 CFR 7.61(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-7.61).

**What language must mandatory information appear in?**

Except as noted in the next sentence, mandatory information must appear on labels of malt beverages in the English language, with the exception of the brand name. Malt beverages bottled for consumption within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may bear labels with mandatory information solely in Spanish. Other statements in foreign languages, including translations of mandatory information that appear elsewhere in English on the label, are allowed on labels and containers as long as they do not in any way conflict with, or contradict, the requirements of part 7. See [27 CFR 7.55(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-7.55).

**Additional Information**

Additional, non-mandatory information, such as a description of the product, a UPC code, or a “drink responsibly” statement, may also appear on any label on the container as long as the information is truthful, accurate, and specific. See [27 CFR 7.56(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7#7.56).
