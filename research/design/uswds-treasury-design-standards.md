## Federal Mandated Design Standards (USWDS)

Federal agencies, including Treasury, are required to follow a standard web design system for public-facing websites. **Congress passed the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (21st Century IDEA)** which mandates that executive agencies adhere to the official U.S. government web design standards.

These standards are developed by GSA's Technology Transformation Services and embodied in the **U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)**.

The White House's OMB reinforced this in **Memorandum M-23-22**, requiring agencies to use a consistent visual design and brand identity across their websites and digital services.

### Key Aspects of USWDS

- **Standardized Design Components**: USWDS provides a library of ready-made, responsive UI components (navigation bars, forms, buttons, etc.) and a default style theme
- **Accessibility and Mobile-Friendliness**: All designs must comply with Section 508 and WCAG guidelines
- **Plain Language and UX Best Practices**: User-centered design, usability testing, clear language

## Treasury's Implementation: Treasury Digital Design System (TDDS)

The **Treasury Digital Design System (TDDS)** is Treasury's open-source design system providing department-specific UX guidance and reusable web components.

> "Our component names derive from U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) CSS naming conventions"

TDDS builds on the USWDS foundation while incorporating Treasury's branding (official colors, fonts, seal).

## TTB Specific Example

> "The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) built a new online platform using a design system based on USWDS, which ensures the interface is mobile-responsive, 508-accessible, and visually consistent across all TTB web services."

## Practical Implications for This Project

1. Use Treasury/USWDS approved UI components and style sheets
2. Ensure accessibility requirements are met
3. Follow established look (fonts, colors, spacing)
4. Consider that TTB already uses USWDS-based design
